# SATS

Due to privacy concerns, i am not allowed to show any code or detailed information about the programming. I can however show screenshots of the user-flow:

This screenshot shows the homepage of the SATS app, with a new "schedule your workout" button.

Once this button has been pressed, you are redirected to the schedule page, where you can customize your new upcoming workout. Types include strength, cardio and mobility.
You can also select whether the workout should be re-occuring, which automatically puts it on your calendar. Finally you can select a SATS club to attach the workout to, a custom workout description, and whether the workout should be private. If you chose to not make it private, you can invite friends who can join your workout.

This image shows the scheduled workout page, which you just created. This page can be accessed by clicking on it once it appears on your calendar, at the top of the homepage. It shows all the information about your workout. 

Once the workout has been finished (which is registered once the allotted time has passed since the allotted beginning time), it will appear in your activity history, if chosen to re-occuring will reappear on your calendar for the next week, and you will be able to rate the workout.
